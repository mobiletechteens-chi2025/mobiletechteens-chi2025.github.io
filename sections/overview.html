      Teens' mobile technology use can foster meaningful connections and social interactions, but it also raises
      concerns around overuse,
      addiction, and exposure to harmful content. Traditional tools and methods for parental controls and guidance for
      mobile technology use among teens, such as screen time limits, often fail to address teens' nuanced experiences
      on the benefits and harm of their mobile technology use. Simply counting hours or restricting screen time
      overlooks important factors such as the quality of technology use, family dynamics, and social context,
      particularly in the context of emerging technologies and diverse sociocultural influences.

    <p class="pb-5">
      The HCI field increasingly recognizes the need to move beyond these narrow approaches, embracing more nuanced
      strategies that consider the diverse ways teens engage with technology. This workshop brings together
      interdisciplinary researchers, practitioners, and teen advocates to create a space for rethinking and reshaping
      the discourse on teen mobile technology use and well-being. Specifically
      <span class="font-bold">
        it aims to examine how the CHI community can foster healthy teen mobile-technology relationships.

      Our goals for this workshop are to:
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 pb-5 italic">
      <li>Co-design future research agenda by identifying blind spots in current approaches</li>
      <li>Foster cross-sociocultural collaboration to address the unique needs of teens for healthy mobile technology
        use</li>
      <li>Generate guidance for stakeholders (e.g., public, policymakers, parents, healthcare providers)</li>
      <li>Plan actionable next steps for ongoing impact</li>
    </ol>
    </p>


    The workshop will explore themes like <span class="font-bold italic">engaging broader stakeholders, embracing
      marginalized
      voices, and navigating
      the implications of emerging technologies</span> through panel presentations and interactive sessions.
    By examining these
    themes, we aim to
    re-explore the HCI community's discourse on teen mobile technology use and well-being, fostering a comprehensive
    understanding and inclusive approaches to navigate the multifaceted challenges in the modern digital landscape in
    diverse sociocultural contexts.
