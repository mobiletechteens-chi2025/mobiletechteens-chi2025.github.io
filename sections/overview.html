      Teens' mobile technology use can help teens connect with one another, but it also raises concerns around overuse,
      addiction, and exposure to harmful content. Traditional tools and methods for parental controls and guidance for
      mobile technology use among children, such as screen time limits, often fail to address teens' nuanced experiences
      on the benefits and harm on their mobile technology use.
      <span class="font-bold">
        This workshop brings together interdisciplinary researchers, practitioners, and teen advocates to examine how
        the
        CHI community can foster healthy teen mobile-technology relationships.

      Our goals are to:
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 pb-5">
      <li>co-design research agenda</li>
      <li>foster cross-sociocultural collaboration</li>
      <li>generate guidance for stakeholders (e.g., public, policymakers, parents, healthcare providers)</li>
      <li>plan actionable steps for ongoing impact</li>
    </ol>
    </p>


    The workshop will explore themes like <span class="font-bold italic">engaging broader stakeholders, embracing
      marginalized
      voices, and navigating
      the implications of emerging technologies</span> through panel presentations and interactive sessions.
    By examining these
    themes, we aim to
    re-explore the HCI community's discourse on teen mobile technology use and well-being, fostering a comprehensive
    understanding and inclusive approaches to navigate the multifaceted challenges in the modern digital landscape in
    diverse sociocultural contexts.
