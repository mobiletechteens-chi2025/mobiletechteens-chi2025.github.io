  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
    We invite researchers, practitioners, and students to join our full-day, in-person workshop, which aims to broaden
    the conversation on teens' mobile technology use and well-being. This workshop will explore interdisciplinary
    approaches to discussing alternative strategies for fostering healthy relationships with mobile technology for
    teens, accounting for sociocultural diversity and emerging technologies.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
    We invite submissions in the form of short position papers (2-4 pages, <a
      href="https://chi2025.acm.org/chi-publication-formats/" target="_blank" class="underline">ACM format</a>)
    <br />
    Contributions can be:
  <ol class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li>
      <span class="font-bold">Research Position Papers</span> that explore, but are not limited to, theoretical or
      empirical research, design fictions, or novel systems/tools related to teens’ mobile technology use and well-being
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="font-bold">Memoir Position Papers</span> that enrich the discourse by offering unique perspectives on
      teens' mobile technology use and associated well-being issues.
    </li>
  </ol>
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
    Given the importance of sociocultural contexts, participants are encouraged to share their lived
    experiences—specific, meaningful events that highlight subjective or emotional insights from the first-person
    perspective, providing alternative viewpoints on these issues
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
    Participants may contribute both as researchers and as parents (or grandparents), and we also invite them to
    co-write with their teens to capture multiple perspectives within the household
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4 text-gray-700">
    Papers should be submitted via Google Form (to be announced). A subset of refereed submissions will be selected for
    presentation during the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the workshop proceedings, and at least one
    author must attend the workshop. The planned workshop activities include interactive discussions and panel speakers.
